 8051 Modular Embedded System (Assembly)

This project demonstrates a modular embedded system developed entirely in Assembly language for the 8051 microcontroller. The system is divided into four functional modules, each addressing a unique application scenario through direct register-level control and peripheral interfacing.

 Modules Overview

 Module 1 – Calculator Interface
A basic calculator that takes input from a keypad and displays results on an LCD. Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations using BCD arithmetic.

 Module 2 – Real-Time Timer Display
Implements a real-time digital timer using 8051’s timer registers. The LCD displays time in seconds and minutes, auto-incremented with precise timing logic.

 Module 3 – Level-Based Game
A simple interactive game where the player progresses through difficulty levels based on keypad input and real-time response. Built with interrupt-based event detection.

 Module 4 – Attendance Logger
Allows name entry via keypad and stores/retrieves attendance logs from EEPROM. Includes menu navigation for viewing stored entries.
